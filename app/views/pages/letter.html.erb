    <p>Dear Flabby,</p>
    <p>I love you. You are the most amazing person in my life because, around you, I am my real self. With you, I feel fearless, ridiculous, talkative, happy, and so much more. You can’t even realize how much I love you.</p>
    <p>You are the reason I truly understood the warmth of hugs and kisses. You mean so much to me. You are the craziest part of my life, and I want this beautiful madness to last forever.</p>
    <p>You are the best friend I have ever had. No words can truly express my feelings for you, but if I had one wish, it would be to spend my life with you.</p>
    <p>I want to be there for you every day—to protect you, to see you, and to make sure you always feel loved and appreciated.</p>
    <p>You mean a lot to me. Every moment we spend together is precious, and I cherish them all.</p>

    <p>With love, ❤️</p>
